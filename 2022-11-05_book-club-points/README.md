# Book Club Points

## Task

Serendipity Booksellers has a book club that awards points to its customers based on the number of books purchased each month. The points are awarded as follows:

- If a customer purchases 0 books, they earn 0 points.
- If a customer purchases 1 book, they earn 5 points.
- If a customer purchases 2 book, they earn 15 points.
- If a customer purchases 3 book, they earn 30 points.
- If a customer purchases 4 or more books, they earn 60 points.

Design a program that asks the user to enter the number of books that they have purchased this month and displays the number of points awarded.
