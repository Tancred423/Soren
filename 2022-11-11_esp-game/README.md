# ESP Game

## Task

Design a program that tests your ESP, or extrasensory perception. The program will randomly pick a color, and you will be asked to predict the programâ€™s selection before it is revealed. Design the program to randomly select one of the following words:

Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow

To select a word, the program can generate a random number. For example, if the number is 0, the selected word is Red, if the number is 1, the selected word is Green, and so forth. Next, the program should ask the user to enter the color that the computer has selected. After the user has entered their guess, the program should display the name of the randomly selected color. The program should repeat this 10 times and then display the number of times the user correctly guessed the selected color.
