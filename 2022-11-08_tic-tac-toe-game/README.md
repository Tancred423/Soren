# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Task

Design a program that allows two players to play a game of tic-tac-toe. Use a two-dimensional String array with three rows and three columns as the game board. Each element of the array should be initialized with an asterisk (\*). The program should run a loop that does the following:

1. Displays the contents of the board array.
2. Allows player 1 to select a location on the board for an X. The program should ask the user to enter the row and column number.
3. Allows player 2 to select a location on the board for an O. The program should ask the user to enter the row and column number.
4. Determines whether a player has won or if a tie has occurred. If a player has won, the program should declare that player the winner and end. If a tie has occurred, the program should say so and end.
5. Player 1 wins when there are three Xs in a row on the game board. Player 2 wins when there are three Os in a row on the game board. The winning Xs or Os can appear in a row, in a column, or diagonally across the board. A tie occurs when all of the locations on the board are full, but there is no winner.
